The Google test for reCaptch. Tell if your a robot or not
## WHAT IS RECAPTCHA?
reCAPTCHA protects your website from fraud and abuse without creating friction.

reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to keep malicious software from engaging in abusive activities on your website. Meanwhile, legitimate users will be able to login, make purchases, view pages, or create accounts and fake users will be blocked.
